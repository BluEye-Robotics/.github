# Blueye Robotics

We believe millions could be saved, accidents reduced, marine life improved, and knowledge enhanced if underwater inspections were made more frequently.

We believe in acting proactively versus reactively. Therefore, we want to empower people with user-friendly and robust underwater technology.

Blueye has its roots in the highly renowned Centre for Autonomous Marine Operations and Systems (AMOS) at NTNU in Norway. Exceptional ease of use and robustness has been the overarching design goals since the beginning. Drawing on competence from world-leading marine engineers, seasoned software developers and award-winning industrial-, mechanics- and electronics designers we have created what we strongly believe are the worldâ€™s best underwater drones.
